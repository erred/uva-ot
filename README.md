Project ideas

signed binaries

- (on linux) executable files can have arbitrary data attached to the end
- LD_PRELOAD lets us hook into execve
- sign binaries and verify on each run

software ecosystem

- promgramming languages are often evaluated on memory safety
- dependencies / ecosystem are an easier entrypoint (ex npm)
- evaluate security of different language dependency ecosystems

apparmor / selinux

- permissions, but not often used / easy to get wrong?
- check existing / available rules for being too relaxed?

less concrete ideas

- keybase trust / weakest link
- something to do with security keys
